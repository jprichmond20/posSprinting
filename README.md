# pos1.0
I have not installed any extensions yet but I plan on installing a few quality of life plugins like rainbow brackets for my own benefit.

I was successful at creating a barebones POS app but not in the way I originally intended. My plan was to use the custom control from the repository shared with us and change the format to fit my design idea but I was unable to find out how to reference the buttons inside of the separate objects.
The main roadblock for me this week was finding out how to custom module worked that we were given to play with. I struggled to figure out how to access the object from the main program so I could set listeners to the buttons and have it interact with other objects.
I would like to go through and try to make my own custom controller from scratch and learn to access them from outside of the object.
